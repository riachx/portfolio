- Designed 3D assets for the virtual platform VirBELA - an Enterprise Metaverse that brings people together to work, learn, and train in an immersive virtual world.
- As the first high school intern, I worked closely with the design lead of Virbela to 3d model assets for virtual events with thousands of attendees.
- Modeled, textured, and rendered 3D assets with unwrapped UVs
- Prepared low-poly models for optimized usage in Unity
- Assets I designed were deployed in their production environment for thousands to view and interact with.
